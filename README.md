### Not all apps are perfect, nor are too good to be, or it was good but not for now... maybe never to be good like old days...

#### This opinion won't coverage to any users that use Android over than 5.0.x
All newer versions of app will optimise to later OS version of devices, downgrading the apps back to unsupported version is possibly to make apps non-functional, unable to use or the app will permanent crash!

All personal opinion (for example, about why i won't update to present/newer versions?) will write in blockquote...
> like this!

Note: If you want to download older version of apps, consider to use [Yalp Store](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore) or [Aurora Store](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/galaxy-playstore-alternative-t3739733) and put the build number from bracket
> Login is optional because those apps will use built-in token dispenser, you can login with your account at your own risk! (because it's **really violate the big brother's terms**)

### [Apex Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anddoes.launcher)
Known good version: 3.0.1 (3010)
> - All effects are more laggy than known good ver.
> - **`Google Firebase`** added for tracking and measuring usages
>   - Even the app already have `Google Analytics`, but it's not enough.

### [Google Translate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate)
Known good version: 5.7.0.RC02.145020128 (57000262)
> - Newer than this version will auto log me in with existing Google accounts, that's all!

### [Play of the game Meme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.atlassc.playofthegamememe)
Known good version: 1.4.1 (25)
> - Ads, Tracking, Sith lord!
> - It was an open source, now then...? the devs removed everything and leave only readme, also no trace to dig back!
> - It's not an unexpected from chinese dev(s) that they will built some apps or tools for free, then turn it to non-free or added ads and tracking later, or worst case is sell their works to shady company, like it's happened to QuickPic, Particle (aka YouTube Plus {Chrome Extension}), also Iridium that was added cryptominer and realize what's the problem, then removed it later on.

### [QuickPic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alensw.PicFolder)
Known good version: 4.5.2 (159) or use [Revived version from XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-quickpic-v4-5-2-classic-version-t3204543)
> - Acquished by `Cheetah Mobile` who create crap cleaner and fake security apps, the main feature of them is inject ads and horrible annoyance on your phone!
> - I hate chinese ppls developers who create the good apps and then inject ads and tracking or resell to company later, same as POTG Meme above, but this app is worst case than that.
>   **Why not recommend newer version with modded?**
>   - Currently, none of any modded versions can remove `Google Firebase` out of this app.
>   - You can use them at your own risk, but personality, I will trade the privacy over the functionality, my parent use Nokia 6 and I've setup 4.5.2 (with revived version) already, although it's have some UI problem issue like pink text, but I guss the app functionality shouldn't have any problem for now.
