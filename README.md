# AppComplaints
Just a personal opinion and you should avoid my though.

- - - - -

### Not all apps are perfect, nor are too good to be, or it was good but not for now... maybe never to be good like old days...

#### This opinion won't coverage to any users that use Android over than 5.0.x

All personal opinion (for example, about why i won't update to present/newer versions?) will write in blockquote...
> like this!

Note: If you want to download older version of apps, consider to use [Yalp Store](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore) and put the build number from bracket
> Login is optional because it will use built-in token dispenser, you can login with your account at your own risk! (because it's **really violate the big brother's terms**)

### [Apex Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anddoes.launcher)
Known good version: 3.0.1 (3010)
> - All effects are more laggy than known good ver.
> - **`Google Firebase`** added for tracking and measuring usages
>   - Even the app already have `Google Analytics`, but it's not enough.

### [Google Translate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate)
Known good version: 5.7.0.RC02.145020128 (57000262)
> - Newer than this version will auto log me in with existing Google accounts, that's all!

### [Play of the game Meme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.atlassc.playofthegamememe)
Known good version: 1.4.1 (25)
> - Ads, Tracking, Sith lord!
> - It was an open source, now then...? the devs [removed everything and leave only readme](https://github.com/ShinChven/potg_meme), also no trace to dig back!
> - It's not an unexpected from chinese dev(s) that they will built some apps or tools for free, then turn it to non-free or added ads and tracking later, or worst case is sell their works to shady company, like it's happened to QuickPic, Particle (aka YouTube Plus {Chrome Extension}), also Iridium that was added cryptominer and realize what's the problem, then removed it later on.
